1. It has been built on jdk-9.0.4
2. Assumptions:
     1. Only one discount will applicable at a time as of now. 
        Ex: If we have added discount on product 
            then we add discount on category level will replace previous one.
           
     2. 'Discount can't be applied' validation is missed as of now, need to implement.
     3. Test cases need to write.
     4. I have splitted input data file into data.txt and query.txt which are located under src/main/resources
     5. I mostly focused on design.
     
 NOTE:   1,2 and 3 assumptions will be solved shortly.
